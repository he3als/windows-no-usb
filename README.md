# Windows No USB ðŸ’¿
A PowerShell script to install Windows (from these files: `.iso, .esd, .wim`) onto another partition (dual booting), without restarting or the use of external installation media, e.g. USB flash drives. ðŸ’¾

No real documentation will be provided, but for this script, you will need:
1) A Windows image (`.iso, .esd, .wim`)
2) An NTFS partition (without Windows on it) to deploy Windows to, which is on an internal drive with enough storage
3) Windows (to run the script)
